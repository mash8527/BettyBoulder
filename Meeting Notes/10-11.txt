Front-End Development and Integration
The team made significant progress on the mobile app front end, led by Gauri Karkhile, who quickly learned Flutter and developed a functional prototype with user and agent interfaces (01:05).

Gauri built the app front end and backend authentication module using Golang and Postgres, despite starting Flutter knowledge from zero (01:05)

She used Copilot with Sonnet 4.5 model to speed up development and created responsive code adaptable to web and mobile.
The front end currently shows separate dashboards for users and agents, with static content placeholders for AI chatbot and profiles.
Backend integration is incomplete due to some authentication connection issues, which she is actively troubleshooting.
This early prototype lets the team evaluate the app’s structure and user flows, setting a foundation for further enhancements.
CU Boulder team assigned Charlotte Hauke and Calvin Schaller to collaborate with Gauri on mobile and web development respectively (07:31)

They will organize a meeting this week to review Gauri’s codebase and discuss integration strategies.
Bert Beckmann emphasized improving product specifications based on this working prototype to guide future development.
The team plans to research database design and AI integration requirements in parallel to align front-end and backend efforts.
This collaboration aims to accelerate the delivery of a polished app that clearly serves both real estate agents and buyers.
Backend Architecture and Data Strategy
The backend will rely on Golang for server-side logic and Postgres for user and property data storage, hosted on a Digital Ocean server (13:48).

The backend team is tasked with designing a database schema to support two user classes: real estate agents and buyers (08:50)

Agents will primarily be customers of the SaaS, while buyers are their clients, requiring differentiated data handling.
The schema must accommodate property details, user profiles, and a repository of Boulder-specific real estate knowledge to support AI features.
Early backend work includes authentication module development and setting up data storage for agent listings and buyer interactions.
The team will research database design and backend tools this week to align system capabilities with front-end needs.
There is a strategic decision to minimize manual property entry by agents by integrating with MLS databases or scraping real estate websites (09:53)

MLS access requires establishing partnerships with realtors to enable database queries for property data.
The system will pull comprehensive property info from MLS and realtor.com URLs to keep data accurate and up to date.
Agents will only need to enter unique property details unavailable from public sources, reducing their workload.
This approach aims to improve data quality, speed up content population, and enhance user experience for both agents and buyers.
AI Integration and User Experience
The team is exploring advanced AI features, including an animated AI assistant named Betty Boulder, to create a knowledgeable and engaging experience for real estate buyers (09:53).

Bert Beckmann highlighted the need to research HeyGen and alternative AI animation tools for Betty Boulder’s avatar and voice (09:53)

HeyGen offers high-quality animation but is expensive; the team wants to explore custom solutions that replicate its capabilities cost-effectively.
Everyone on the CU Boulder team is encouraged to research and provide feedback on Betty’s design, voice, and interaction style to refine the user experience.
The current Betty demo is a 15-second animated video shared in the project channel for team review and input.
The AI chatbot will eventually be integrated into the user dashboard to assist buyers with Boulder real estate knowledge.
The AI model integration will leverage the backend infrastructure and the rich Boulder real estate data being collected (02:23)

The chatbot interface currently exists as a placeholder in the app’s user view, showing where the AI will interact with users.
The team aims to build an AI assistant that is both informative and entertaining, enhancing buyer engagement and satisfaction.
Research into large language models (LLMs) will help determine the best AI model suited for local real estate knowledge and conversational capabilities.
This AI focus aligns with the product’s differentiation strategy by combining real estate data with personalized, smart assistance.
Team Coordination and Workflow Management
The team is establishing communication and coordination routines to maintain steady progress and transparency (15:11).

A dedicated stand-up channel will be created for members to post progress updates, blockers, and help requests every few days (15:11)

This approach aims to keep everyone aligned and allow early identification of issues or resource needs.
Saturday meetings at the agreed time will continue weekly to review progress and set next steps.
Bert Beckmann encourages a culture of open sharing and quick feedback to foster collaboration.
This communication rhythm supports distributed team members across time zones and disciplines.
Roles have been clearly assigned: all members will contribute to backend work, with Charlotte and Calvin leading mobile and web front-end efforts respectively (07:31)

This role clarity helps focus expertise where it is most impactful and ensures coverage of key technical areas.
Bert Beckmann will facilitate cross-team connections, including setting up joint meetings to review code and design decisions.
The team’s early delegation of responsibilities sets the stage for efficient parallel development and faster delivery.
This structure also supports onboarding new members like Gauri and integrates their work smoothly.
Product Vision and Market Positioning
The project is positioned as a SaaS platform serving real estate agents with buyers as end users, emphasizing ease of use and rich local knowledge (08:50).

Bert Beckmann clarified the dual-user model: agents are customers paying for the service, while buyers are their clients engaging with AI tools (08:50)

This model influences design decisions to ensure agents find value in managing listings efficiently.
Buyers receive a tailored AI experience that helps them navigate Boulder’s real estate market with expert-level information.
The integration with MLS and realtor.com supports market competitiveness by offering up-to-date and comprehensive property data.
The vision is to transform real estate search with AI-driven insights and a streamlined agent interface.
The team is focused on building a differentiated product that combines AI, data integration, and user-friendly design to disrupt traditional real estate tools (09:53)

Including animated AI avatars and conversational assistants aims to create a unique and engaging user experience.
Reducing manual data entry for agents enhances product appeal and adoption potential.
The platform’s local focus on Boulder real estate knowledge builds a competitive moat through specialization.
This strategic approach guides technology choices and prioritizes features that bring clear business value.
