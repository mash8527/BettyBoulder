Now working on the execution phase, which includes the chatbot.

There are some issues with web scraping and getting the data. Sharon is working on figuring out a solution.

Everyone must submit minimum 2 PRs per week.
This week, I need code + output from every member — no exceptions.
Next meeting, I will review everyone’s actual code, not discussions.
Web scraping is facing blockers (firewalls, captchas, only 41 records scraped). We must find a solution for multi-page scraping urgently.
LLM team must come with proof/results, not plans.
CI/CD setup has not started — Manav, we need updates and scripts.
From now on, only code, PRs, and results matter — no vague updates.

Everyone must follow the workflow for any work done:
- Make flowchart
- Write code
- Test output
- Compare & refine
- Submit PR

Ask Bert about what to do over winter break.
