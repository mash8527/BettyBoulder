Gauri is travelling today, so Charlotte was asked to host the meeting. Gauri only wanted to know about any updates on CI/CD and web scraping.

Manav could not attend today's meeting, so we have no updates on CI/CD, but it is in progress. 

Data scraping issues are still being researched/worked on. 

Sharon found an open-source library on GitHub that was made to bypass Cloudflare Firewalls. Here is the link to that: https://github.com/sarperavci/CloudflareBypassForScraping

Here are some other sites with information that could be useful, although some advertise their paid web scraping services:
