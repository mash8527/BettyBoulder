Notes
Project Progress and Onboarding
The team has begun initial setup and familiarization with the project tools and codebase to prepare for active development.

Sansh Goel completed learning JIRA and gained access to Git repositories but has yet to clone the repo locally (04:13)

Gauri emphasized the cloning and setup of the repo as the first essential task.
Sansh plans to complete cloning today and seek help via Slack if issues arise.
Sansh’s onboarding progress sets the stage for task assignments and coding work.
This foundational step is critical to ensure all team members work on the same codebase and track progress effectively.
Manav Shah reviewed the backend repo focusing on user and property models and plans to add an appointment model next week (04:38)

Manav confirmed the project runs properly on his local machine.
Adding the appointment model aligns with the project roadmap to expand backend features.
Manav’s focus on backend modeling supports the core functionality for property and booking management.
This prepares the team to handle more complex interactions between users and properties soon.
Sharon Xiang is familiarizing herself with both backend and frontend code and reviewing flow diagrams (05:15)

Sharon has not cloned the repo yet but is gaining critical understanding of system flow.
This knowledge will help her contribute effectively once coding tasks begin.
Early exposure to design diagrams helps reduce onboarding time later.
Project Workflow and Task Management via JIRA
The team agreed on a structured task management process using JIRA to improve clarity, accountability, and progress tracking.

Gauri Karkhile outlined a detailed JIRA workflow with tickets categorized as epics, stories, tasks, and bugs to manage the BT Boulder project efficiently (07:19)

Major features like user authentication will be epics broken into user stories and coding/testing tasks.
Each ticket includes description, assignee, priority, status, deadlines, and comments for updates.
Team members must move tasks through “to do,” “in progress,” and “done” to maintain visibility.
Weekly meetings will review JIRA progress to ensure alignment and avoid confusion.
Gauri created initial JIRA tickets and encouraged team members to assign tasks to themselves or create new tickets as needed (09:10)

Team members were instructed to regularly update their ticket statuses to reflect real-time progress.
Bugs found during testing must be logged as JIRA tickets for timely resolution.
This approach will maintain a clear work pipeline and improve issue tracking and resolution speed.
Gauri will monitor JIRA boards to understand workloads and identify blockers early.
Technical Decisions on User Verification
Phone number verification was selected as the exclusive authentication method for its simplicity and user friendliness.

The team decided to implement OTP verification solely via phone number, excluding email, to keep the process straightforward (10:11)
Gauri explained that email verification adds complexity and reduces user friendliness.
Phone number verification is more universal and accessible for all users.
This decision streamlines the registration flow and reduces potential friction for new users.
The choice aligns with the project’s goal of fast onboarding and easy access.
Product Architecture and Feature Roadmap
The BT Boulder platform is designed as a real estate system connecting property owners and agents with an AI chatbot for property suggestions.

Gauri provided a clear overview of the system’s architecture involving Flutter frontend and Golang backend with user and agent workflows (05:32)

User flow includes registration, login, browsing properties, AI chatbot interaction, and booking inquiries.
Agent flow covers registration, property listing management, buyer chat, and booking tracking.
Plans for a future admin panel will enable activity monitoring and listing approvals.
This phased approach prioritizes core user-agent interactions before adding admin oversight.
Manav’s planned appointment model addition fits into expanding backend capabilities to support booking and scheduling features (04:38)

The roadmap clearly sequences backend model development to align with front-end user needs.
This ensures backend readiness before full feature rollouts, reducing integration risks.
Communication and Collaboration Norms
The team emphasized the importance of ongoing communication and status updates to keep everyone aligned and responsive.

Gauri instructed team members to keep Slack updates frequent and clear to track progress and quickly address issues (11:45)

This real-time communication complements JIRA’s structured task tracking.
It allows quick clarifications and fosters a collaborative problem-solving culture.
Regular status sharing will help Gauri manage dependencies and resource allocation effectively.
The weekly meetings combined with JIRA updates create a feedback loop ensuring transparency and accountability (07:19)

This process aims to prevent task overlaps and identify blockers early.
It supports a disciplined yet flexible work environment suitable for a distributed team.
